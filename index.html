          This is the cutest gangland territorial conflict you will ever witness.<br>Written by Lam Yik Chun

      <h4>
        <p>  
          Singapore's otter population has found their way into the hearts and Facebook albums of the citizens of Singapore. The smooth-coated otters first made their way down from the Malaysian Peninsula, and the family grew. But they are highly territorial animals, and Singapore's a tiny place.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few territorial squabbles have been documented on Singaporean social media platforms, but they seemed pretty disjointed. Except, they aren't.

              <p>  
                Good things don't typically happen when humans come into contact with undomesticated wildlife. Otter fights might be heartbreaking to watch, but is it really the responsiblity of humans to interfere with nature? Otters and their counterparts aren't the invasive species here - we are.
              </p>
              <p>
                In an increasingly urbanised Singapore, there seem to be 2 options at hand - continue to urbanise and get ready to scrap with animals, or respect their territory and find more ways to coexist.

            <h2>The Shortest Long River</h2>
            <p>
              This is the Kallang River system, the longest in Singapore at a whopping 10 kilometers. (about 6 1/4 miles for you imperial system folks)<br><br>
              The Kallang River runs all the way from the Central Catchment Area, to the mouth of the Kallang River Basin. It's also where conflicts like this happen:<br><br>

            <p>
              These skirmishes take place in the territorial bounds of the Bishan otter family, Singapore's most famous otter brood.<br><br> Anything in here is fair game. Including your swimming pool, and your prized koi pond:<br><br>

            <h2>2015 | Marina Reservoir</h2>
            <p>
              Originally the domicile of the namesake Marina otter family, Marina Reservoir was set upon by the Bishan otters, looking to stake their claim to the mouth of the Singapore river. The resulting squabble displaced the Marina family to a nomadic existence.

          <div class="step" id="step-three">
            <h2>2015 | Potong Pasir</h2>
            <p>
              The Marina otters were dealt another blow, losing another skirmish when they were caught fishing on Bishan land. Sneaking onto the Singapore River system often happens due to the abundance of prey it contains, compared to the smaller river systems around Singapore.

            <h2>2018 | Kallang Basin</h2>
            <p>
              A popular spot for kayakers and dragon boaters, Kallang River was also where tensions came to a head between the Bishan and Marina otters. The clash resulted in the death of the alpha males of both families, but the Bishan family ultimately retained control of their stretch of river.

            <h2>2020 | Year of the 'Vid</h2>
            <p>
              Perhaps it was the lack of humans ("nature is healing" and all that), or the abundance of time that people had when offices were closed (yay for work-from-home measures), but 2020 was the year with the most recorded otter clashes since 2015.<br><br>
              2 of these recorded skirmishes took place in Bishan Park, one of the neighbourhood parks in Singapore with a natural waterway.

          <div class="step" id="step-five">
            <h2>Another Player Enters The Fray</h2>
            <p>
              This also marked the first recorded conflicts involving a family other than the Bishan and Marina broods - enter the Zouk otters.<br><br> Named for their penchance for hanging out in the proximity of their namesake nightclub, they were involved in 2 of the 3 scuffles in 2020.

              <br><br>
              The willingness of otters to throw hands here also shows how accustomed most wildlife species are in Singapore to human prescence.
